## 🐍 Python-Webscraper

- Eigth example project from [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)
- Uses Pandas and BeautifulSoup to webscrape data from a RealEstate site (cached version due to age) and formats the data into a pandas dataframe/ CSV output


## 📓 Comments

- Easier than expected to pull data in bulk and store in readable format, BeautifulSoup is a very well made library
- Can see how this could be used relatively easily to mass extract and format data, and how you could combine with something like Bokeh to take many different data sources and put it into one readable one


## 💻 Running the app

- Clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the directory, and then use ``` python script1.py  ``` to run the script, you can then see the output in the terminal or in the CSV files saved in the directory
- Alternatively if you are familiar with Jupyter Notebook just open the notebook and you can run the code through that
